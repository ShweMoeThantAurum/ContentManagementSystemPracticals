This is to give brief understanding about how to create a localhost website with a database and its learning journey for week 4
including learning activities & resources, estimated hours, content insights and career/employability/learning insights.


## Learning Journey for Week 4

### Learning Activities & Resources 

As this practical's, Week 4's, instruction described to create a dynamic localhost website with a database, I installed
XAMPP, an open source cross-platform application, firstly so that I can crate a database through that application. While 
installing this application, I faced some troubles not because it is just a developer tool for public users but also I am a 
Macbook user. With the Macbook's security and privacy concerns, it denies to install a developer tool. So, I needed to 
reduce Macbook's built-in security policy. After installing XAMPP application, another problem is that I can only run Apache web server and ProFTDP server but
I cannot run MySQL database server on installed XAMPP application. While finding the root cause of this problem, I 
found that I had another MySQL database server running on my laptop. At that moment, I remembered that I run that another 
SQL database server while I took CP2404 which is Database Modelling subject in JCU. To terminate that database server,
I opened Activity Monitor on my Macbook, which is similar to Services on Windows. After that, obviously, the MySQL database
server in XAMPP worked. To deploy a localhost website, I installed WordPress application. When I downloaded WordPress 
application, we got an zipped package. I unzipped that package with the folder name, "wordpress", under htdocs which is under xamppfiles in my Finder.
Then I searched "https://localhost/wordpress/" on Chrome on my laptop. Then I followed step-by-step instructions. Deploying
a localhost website, I also found "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" for creating a database that will be used in the localhost website.
After completely creating a database, we simply created a WordPress website with the help of WordPress. Then, we finally got 
a website with a database running on localhost. 


To solve the problems I mentioned above, I found videos on YouTube and found [a useful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ4YMxAFlz4) 
for me. 

### Estimated hours

Since the lecturer showed the solution in the practical session, I followed his solution during the session. Therefore,
it basically took just around 2 hours to finish this problem.

### Content Insights 

The practical session aimed to create a dynamic localhost website with a database. I encountered initial hurdles 
during XAMPP installation on my MacBook due to security protocols. Adjusting settings facilitated installation, but a 
conflict with a pre-existing MySQL server surfaced, resolved by terminating the conflicting server via Activity Monitor. 
Deploying a WordPress website involved downloading, unzipping, and accessing it through designated URLs. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights


In the process of deploying a localhost website with a database, I learned that there were under-running servers on my 
laptop, which can be rarely seen. Apparently, I learned about XAMPP and Myphpadmin as a result of the process of deploying a localhost
website. To summarize, this exercise enhanced my understanding of server configurations and database deployment in web development.
