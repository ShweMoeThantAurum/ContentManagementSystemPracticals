## Learning Journey for Week 5

### Learning Activities & Resources

The Week 5's practical instructs to change at least 6 visible customizations. Here is a look at the changes I made to the 
website's style.

* **Thicker Underlines:** I made the underlines of links a bit thicker ('text-decoration-thickness: 1.5px') and adjusted their 
position slightly ('text-underline-offset: 0.15em') to make them more noticeable and better aligned. 
* **Red Links on Hover:** When you hover over or click on a link ('a:hover', 'a:focus'), I changed its color to red ('color: red'). This
gives a clear visual cue that you are interacting with it. 
* **Bigger Text:** The main text on the website now appears larger ('font-size: 32px') to make it more prominent and easier to read.
* **Blue Text Color:** I switched the color of most text to blue ('color: blue') for a more calming and distinct look. 
* **Orange Links:** All the links ('a' tags) now have an orange color ('color: orange') to maintain consistency and make them stand out.
* **Light Gray Background:** The background color is now a soft, light gray ('background-color: lightgray') to create a subtle
backdrop that does not distract from the content but complements the overall design.

### Estimated hours

I spend half a day to finish this practical. 

### Content Insights 

These changes in the website's style were not just about altering colors and sizes. Each tweak aimed to enhance the user's
experience. Thicker underlines and vibrant hover colors were like highlighting key attractions, making navigation more engaging.
Bigger text and calming blue hues drew attention to vital details. Consistent, vibrant link colors acted as markers, ensuring  a 
seamless flow. The soft, lightgray background set the stage, subtly enhancing the entire experience without overshadowing the content.
These changes align with my dedication to crafting an enticing platform. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In the process of changing my website style, I've revised CSS a bit through w3schools. While my immediate career path 
might not heavily involve front-end or back-end development or intricate aspects, the exposure to these concepts broadens 
my understanding of how the websites are designed. Even though these aspects might not be my primary focus, 
they enrich my skill set and contribute to a more well-rounded understanding of deploying websites.
