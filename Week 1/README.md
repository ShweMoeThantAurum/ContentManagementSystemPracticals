## Learning Journey for Week 1

### Learning Activities & Resources

For week 1 practical, I decided to create a tour guide website with orange color based theme. Since this week practical 
needed to create a website by using HTML and CSS, I revised CP1406, which is Web Design and Development subject in JCU. I
also studied w3schools website to revise some specific areas or things I wanted to use in my website. Next, I watched 
one LinkedIn Learning video so that I can apply advanced and interactive designs,i.e.,css in my website.
