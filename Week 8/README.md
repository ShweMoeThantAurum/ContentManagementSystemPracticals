# Getting Started
 
This week, our team is developing a website for the James Cook University open house as part of our group projects.
Initially, we will focus on determining the workflow, recognizing its significance in web deployment. The importance
of an effective workflow in website creation encompasses various aspects, including efficiency, collaboration, 
quality assurance, consistency, client satisfaction, adaptability, time and cost management, documentation, scalability, and security. 
 
# Group Details
 
The part of workflow, defining roles and responsibilities is very important. So, we are divided to our test each team member in the following:

2. [Kaung Sat Paing (14399033)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaung-sat-paing-2b02b825b/?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app) - Coder and Quality Assurance (QA) checker
3. [Zar Chi Oo (14211290)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zarchioo/) - Project Manager
4. [Shwe Moe Thant (14228423)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwe-moe-thant-454473223/) - Coder


As a team, we set [our code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDKkVeRaLh9u8EgRC4VUBGRNnzZF26KD7whVBtHkiJ8/edit?usp=sharing) for our team.
We also try to do [daily meetings](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/OU00RWc1eENZeWJUbnd0aktVVmlBeVhWZERtcWIwVUo2azM3Y3R4ekZEZjVNbnpsUHRjZE1POUUzQTdnS25xYnwzNDU4NzY0NTQxOTQyODkzMzQwfDI=?share_link_id=231631393104), which is inspired from SCRUM process.
 
 
# Project Links
 
As a team, we highly value the project management. Here are the links where you can see our step-by-step version controls
to create a website as team:
1. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShweMoeThantAurum/ContentManagementSystemGroupAssignmentTeam6)
2. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K4nnWSkQ/team-6)
3. [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/namethegroup/shared_invite/zt-29hsfnftw-c_owSNMwG86oE4wNrx7dtQ)

We chose GitHub as our project management tool not because we all are familiar with GitHub but also GitHub is many effective for code development.
1. Repository Creation:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub to host your project's codebase.
2. Branching:
   - Create branches for different features, bug fixes, or development tasks to work on isolated changes.
3. Cloning:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine to have a local copy of the code.
4. Committing:
   - Make changes to the code locally and commit them with clear and concise commit messages.
5. Pushing:
   - Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub to share them with the team.
6. Pull Requests:
   - Open pull requests to propose changes from your branch to the main branch, facilitating code review.
7. Code Review:
   - Collaborate with team members by reviewing and providing feedback on code changes through comments on pull requests.
8. Merging:
   - Merge approved pull requests into the main branch to incorporate the changes into the project.
9. Issues:
   - Use GitHub Issues to track and manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.

# Establishing a testing strategy

Upon completing this project, I have gained extensive knowledge in areas such as WordPress workflow, code development, 
the importance of selecting appropriate hosting, and the dynamics of collaborative group work. Alongside these insights, 
the identification of a proficient testing approach emerges as a crucial element in this undertaking. Testing serves as a 
pivotal checkpoint during development, ensuring the dependability and functionality of the website.  Through this project, I have come to appreciate the 
importance of systematic testing methodologies. This encompasses unit testing to evaluate individual components, integration
testing to assess interactions between different modules, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate that the final product 
aligns with client requirements. The implementation of thorough testing has not only facilitated early bug detection and resolution 
but has also played a significant role in upholding code quality and preventing issues from reaching the production environment. When 
seamlessly integrated into the development workflow, the testing phase contributes to the overall resilience of the website, 
establishing a solid foundation for a positive user experience. Furthermore, this experience underscores the importance of 
crafting and maintaining comprehensive test cases that encompass various scenarios and edge cases. Effective testing, 
coupled with regular feedback loops, has proven instrumental in refining the codebase and enhancing the overall reliability of 
the website. Looking ahead, the lessons learned from formulating and executing a robust testing strategy will undoubtedly shape my approach to 
future web development projects, reinforcing the understanding that meticulous testing is a fundamental component of delivering a successful and resilient website.


# Learning Insights
Through the successful completion of this project, I have acquired valuable insights across various realms of web development. 
This experience has afforded me a comprehensive grasp of the WordPress workflow, delving into the nuances of content management, 
theme customization, and plugin integration. Engaging with WordPress hands-on has not only elevated my technical proficiency 
but has also underscored the importance of selecting the appropriate tools tailored to specific project needs. The journey of 
code development throughout this project has represented a significant learning curve. I have refined my coding skills, exploring
both front-end and back-end aspects. This exposure has highlighted the importance of crafting clean, efficient, and maintainable code. 
The iterative development process, characterized by frequent commits and collaborative code reviews, has instilled in me a deep appreciation
for version control and the Git workflow. The critical decision of choosing a suitable hosting solution played a pivotal role 
in the project's success. I now recognize the impact of hosting on website performance, scalability, and the overall user experience. 
Assessing hosting options, comprehending server configurations, and optimizing for speed and security have become integral components of my skill set. 
Among the most enriching aspects of this project is the exposure to group work dynamics. Collaborating with team members 
such as Zar Chi Oo, Myat Pwint Phyu, and Kaung Sat Paing has introduced a diverse range of skills and perspectives. 
This collaborative experience has imparted lessons on effective communication, task allocation, and mutual support in attaining project 
objectives. It emphasizes that successful web development is not solely about individual technical prowess but also about cohesive teamwork. 
In summary, this project has served as a multifaceted learning journey. From mastering technical intricacies like WordPress workflows and coding practices to making critical decisions such as hosting selection and navigating the dynamics of group collaboration, each facet has contributed to my evolution as a web developer. This experience has not only broadened my technical toolkit but has also cultivated a holistic understanding of the interconnected elements that contribute to the success of web development projects.
