## Group Formation

### Explanation how did I get this group

In preparation for an upcoming assignment, assignment 1, I initiated the formation of a proficient learning team through a 
structured interview process. Utilizing a 'job interview style,' I engaged in concise interviews with each classmate,
posing targeted questions to discern their working styles, availability, diligence, and shared expectations for group
work. Delving into their approaches to task management, collaborative methodologies, and experiences in group
settings provided invaluable insights into their suitability for our team. Amidst these discussions, four 
individuals who are: 
* Myat Pwint Phyu (14318723) 
* Kaung Sat Paing (14399033) 
* Shin Thant Aung (14191080) 
* Zar Chi Oo (14211290)


emerged with attributes that particularly resonated with our collective objectives. These individuals 
showcased not just proficiency in their working styles but also a remarkable commitment to collaborative efforts. 
Their demonstrated dedication, proactive problem-solving skills, and clear alignment of expectations set them apart 
from other candidates. It was evident that their values and work ethics harmoniously aligned with our vision for the 
assignment. By strategically selecting these members, I envisioned a team that not only boasts diverse skills but also 
fosters a cohesive environment primed for successful collaboration.
