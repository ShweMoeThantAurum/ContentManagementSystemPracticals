## Learning Journey for Week 7

### Learning Activities & Resources

The Week 7's practical instructs to form a group and then to prepare for assignment 2 Project. Since this is a group project,
we need to communicate each other and have project management. In that case, we need to do project management tools to get
version controls by our team. The project management tools we use are as follows:
