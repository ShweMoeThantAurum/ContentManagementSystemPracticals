This overview is intended to provide a clear understanding of my website, crafted for the second practical assignment 
in my university's Content Management System course at JCU. Considering the audience as older individuals, 
the website is meticulously designed to be both user-friendly and easily accessible for older people. Let's dive into 
an in-depth explanation of the content and the specific S.M.A.R.T. goals associated with this site:

## Content Explanation
### Explanation about the website and its S.M.A.R.T goals

My initial website from week 1 focused on connecting tourists with local guides, but it was predominantly tailored for 
younger users. To address this, I've developed a parallel site targeting older demographics. This Week 2 project aims 
to offer valuable resources customized for the interests and requirements of older people. The site will encompass:

* Insights into health and wellness 
* Recreational activities suitable for older individuals 
* Information about community events 
* Accessible educational resources 
* Compelling narratives and articles 
* Emphasis on user-friendly navigation and accessibility features


Moreover, the articles within the website will be presented from the viewpoint of older individuals to ensure relatability.

#### S.M.A.R.T Goals of the website:


* **Specific:** Offer easily accessible information on health, wellness, and community events for older individuals in a clear and comprehensible manner.
* **Measurable:** Determine success through active user numbers, content engagement, and feedback from the intended audience.
* **Achievable:** Design the website to be user-friendly, accessible, and engaging for older users, considering their unique needs and preferences.
* **Relevant:** Ensure content pertinence to the interests and concerns of older individuals, focusing on health, leisure, and community engagement.
* **Time-bound:** Launch the website within a specific timeframe and consistently update and refine it based on user feedback and analytics.


Through leveraging Joomla, a Content Management System tool, and integrating these considerations, this website can 
effectively cater to the older demographic planning to explore Singapore.

## Learning Journey for Week 2

### Learning Activities & Resources

In Week 2's assignment, I opted to develop a tour website similar to the one I crafted in Week 1, albeit tailored for 
an older audience. This site leans towards a blog-like format, emphasizing detailed articles rather than a modern 
website layout. As the task mandated Joomla as the Content Management System, I focused on learning Joomla primarily 
through LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.

### Estimated hours

Starting from the evening of 27.11.2023, I engaged in learning Joomla through LinkedIn and YouTube tutorials. After learning
myself with Joomla's interface and tools, I commenced building the website as described earlier. The development process 
spanned around one and a half days. While it may seem a lengthy duration, I preferred a more relaxed approach to the practical. 
To conclude, the learning activities for Week 2 encompassed roughly two and a half days in total.

### Content Insights 

In Week 2's project, I embarked on crafting a tour website tailored explicitly for an older audience, diverging from 
my Week 1 creation. This endeavor aimed to resonate more with older individuals by adopting a blog-like format, 
prioritizing detailed articles over a contemporary website design. Employing Joomla as the Content Management System, 
I dedicated time to understanding its intricacies through resources on LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.

Through this process, I gained a deeper appreciation for tailoring content to specific demographics. 
The emphasis on narrative-driven, comprehensive articles was a deliberate choice to cater to the preferences of 
an older audience seeking substantial information. It was an enlightening experience to blend technology, design, 
and content creation to resonate effectively with a different demographic.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights


* **Career/Employability** Exploring Joomla's functionalities and tailoring content for a different demographic offered a practical 
demonstration of adaptability and versatility in digital content creation. This experience highlighted the 
importance of versatility in catering to diverse audience needs, a crucial skill in a dynamic professional landscape.
Moreover, the conscious choice to create content specifically for older individuals underscored the significance of 
market segmentation and targeted marketing, pivotal aspects in career growth and market positioning.
*  **Learning Insights** The immersion into Joomla through LinkedIn Learning and YouTube unveiled the power of 
self-directed learning in acquiring new skills. This experience reinforced the value of utilizing diverse learning 
resources and platforms to foster a comprehensive understanding of a new tool or technology. Additionally, 
the deliberate approach to learning at one's pace showcased the significance of balance between efficiency and depth in skill acquisition.
